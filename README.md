# Financial and Election Data Analysis

This repository contains two Python scripts for analyzing financial and election data.


## Financial Analysis (Script 1)

The `financial_analysis.py` script analyzes financial data from a CSV file (`budget_data.csv`) and calculates the following:

- Total number of months
- Total net profit/loss
- Average change in profit/loss
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)

The results are both printed to the console and saved to a text file named `financial_analysis.txt` in the "analysis" directory.


## Election Data Analysis (Script 2)

The `election_analysis.py` script analyzes election data from a CSV file (`election_data.csv`) and calculates the following:

- Total number of votes
- List of candidates and their respective vote counts and percentages
- The winner of the election

The election results are printed to the console and saved to a text file named `candidate_analysis.txt` in the "analysis" directory.
